# Multi-signature Wallet Requiring Multiple Approvals for Transactions

## Project Description

The Multi-signature Wallet is a secure smart contract that requires multiple owner approvals before executing any transaction. This decentralized wallet solution eliminates single points of failure by distributing control among multiple trusted parties. Each transaction must be proposed by one owner and confirmed by a predetermined number of other owners before execution.

The wallet supports various operations including Ether transfers, smart contract interactions, and wallet management functions like adding/removing owners. It implements robust security measures including reentrancy protection, comprehensive access controls, and event logging for complete transaction transparency.

This implementation follows industry best practices and is designed for organizations, DAOs, families, or any group requiring shared custody of digital assets with enhanced security through collective decision-making.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create the most secure and user-friendly multi-signature wallet solution that:

- **Eliminates Single Points of Failure**: No single individual can unilaterally control funds, ensuring maximum security through distributed trust
- **Promotes Organizational Security**: Provides enterprise-grade security for businesses, DAOs, and institutions managing significant digital assets
- **Enables Flexible Governance**: Supports customizable approval thresholds and owner management for various organizational structures
- **Ensures Transparency**: Every transaction and approval is recorded on-chain with full audit trails
- **Builds Trust**: Creates confidence in digital asset management through proven cryptographic security and smart contract reliability
- **Democratizes Access**: Makes enterprise-level security accessible to individuals and small organizations

## Key Features

### Core Security Features
- **Multi-Signature Protection**: Requires M-of-N owner approvals for transaction execution

### Transaction Management
- **Transaction Proposal**: Any owner can propose new transactions with destination, value, and data
- **Confirmation System**: Owners can confirm transactions independently with full transparency
- **Revocation Capability**: Owners can revoke their confirmations before transaction execution
- **Execution Control**: Transactions execute only after reaching required confirmation threshold
- **Batch Processing**: Support for complex transaction data including smart contract interactions

### Wallet Administration
- **Dynamic Owner Management**: Add, remove, or replace owners through multi-sig governance
- **Flexible Requirements**: Adjust confirmation requirements based on changing security needs
- **Owner Verification**: Comprehensive validation of owner addresses and uniqueness
- **Minimum Threshold**: Prevents reducing owners below safe operational levels
- **Governance Integration**: All administrative changes require multi-sig approval

### Example Deployment
```javascript
const MultiSigWallet = await ethers.getContractFactory("MultiSigWallet");
const wallet = await MultiSigWallet.deploy(
    ["0x123...", "0x456...", "0x789..."], // owners
    2 // 2-of-3 confirmations required
);
```

### Basic Operations
```javascript
// Submit transaction
await wallet.submitTransaction(recipient, amount, "0x");

// Confirm transaction
await wallet.confirmTransaction(0);

// Execute transaction (after sufficient confirmations)
await wallet.executeTransaction(0);
```

### Administrative Operations
```javascript
// Add new owner (requires multi-sig approval)
const addOwnerData = wallet.interface.encodeFunctionData("addOwner", [newOwner]);
await wallet.submitTransaction(wallet.address, 0, addOwnerData);
```
